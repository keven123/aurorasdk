The goal of this project is to develop a web based Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The client only needs a web browser and an internet connection. By connecting to the server, an IDE looking page is downloaded by the browser that looks like and has the functionality of an IDE environment. The client is able to access previous code stored in the database or create new projects, compile the code and run it.
